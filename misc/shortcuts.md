- CTRL + Arrows keys are an alternative to the normal EMACS shortcuts and useful, if I want to keep other functionality on those keys. e.g. CTRL + A, and so on.
- CTRL + X does not only remove the whole line till line break, but also copies it's content into cliboard. At least when using Pycharm or Vscode.
